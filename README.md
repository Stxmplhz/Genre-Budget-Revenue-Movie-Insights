**Film Analytics: Genre Trends, Budget & Revenue Prediction**

This project uses data science and machine learning to extract insights from the film industry. It focuses on four key objectives:
- Genre Trend Analysis – Identifying high-revenue genres over time and visualizing audience preference shifts.
- Budget Estimation – Predicting production budgets using film features like genre, runtime, and creators.
- Revenue Prediction – Forecasting movie revenue with machine learning models.

**Key Techniques**
- EDA to explore revenue trends, runtime patterns, and audience engagement.
- Data preprocessing: handling outliers, encoding multi-label genres, and preparing categorical data.
- Clustering (K-Means) to group films into meaningful archetypes.
- Regression (CatBoost + Optuna) for budget and revenue prediction with strong performance.

**Outcome**
The project demonstrates that genres, budget, runtime, and creator data can effectively predict financial success. It offers practical insights for producers, investors, and content strategists to guide decisions in film production and investment.
